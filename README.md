# Employee Tracker
Assignment for Week 12 - SQL for bootcamp.

## Task
Create a backend content management systems (CMS) application for tracking employees that can be easily interacted with. The user can view all employees, all roles, and all departments; the user can add an employee, add a role, add a department and update an employee; the user can delete an employee, delete a role, and delete a department. And finally the user can log out from the application.

This entire application runs in the backend, so it runs in the interface; and for the dependencies, it requires: `Node.js`, `inquirer` (specifically `inquirer@8.2.4`), `express` and `mysql`. I also personally added using `dotenv`, `console.table`, and `chalk` (for the optional, yet nifty-looking, sorta 8-bit styled logo to accentuate the interface of the CMS).

Since this application is entirely backend and won't be deployed as a viewable site, here's a walkthrough video showing the functionality of the application.
