# Employee Tracker
Assignment for Week 12 - SQL for bootcamp.

## Task
Create a backend content management systems (CMS) application for tracking employees that can be easily interacted with. The user can view all employees, all roles, and all departments; the user can add an employee, add a role, add a department and update an employee; the user can delete an employee, delete a role, and delete a department. And finally the user can log out from the application.

This entire application runs in the backend, so it runs in the interface; and for the dependencies, it requires: `Node.js`, `inquirer` (specifically `inquirer@8.2.4`), `express` and `mysql`. I also personally added `dotenv`, `console.table`, and `chalk` (for the optional, yet nifty-looking, sorta 8-bit styled logo to accentuate the interface of the CMS).

As a small note, with this assignment I did discover how difficult backend technogoly was, and so there are parts of the .sql files and the sql queries in the index.js file that are a bit wonky and so the data probably doesn't show completely correct. It took a LOT of trial and error and help from a few tutors to get it working as much as it is. Also the only function that really does not work is deleting a department.

Since this application is entirely backend and won't be deployed as a viewable site, here's a walkthrough video showing the functionality of the application.
